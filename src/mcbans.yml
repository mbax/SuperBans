#MCBans Configuration
#If you wish to use MCBans, make sure it is enabled in config.yml
#
#FEATURES CONFIGURATION
# Here, we define what features you wish to be enabled.
# In order, we have the ban command, unban command,
#  lookup command
# Then, there's MinRep
#   MinRep lets you define a minimum MCBans reputation
#    for all players joining your server.
# CheckAtLogin will check for bans from your server
#  and bans from the MCBans system (0/10 rep) and
#   will block users from joining based on that.
#   I advise leaving this disabled unless you only use MCBans
# Lastly, CallBack is required if you wish to show up on
#  the MCBans system as an active server

#SETTINGS CONFIGURATION
# If you have enabled MinRep above, define a value above 0 here
# For instance, MinRep of 5.0 means nobody with a rep below
#  5.0 can join your server
# Default value: 0.0, also known as "anybody can join!"
# 
# Be sure to set your APIKEY here. You can find this on your dashboard.
